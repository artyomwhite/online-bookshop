This is a handy and secure app which allows users to make purchases online.
Admins can add new books to DB, all books have categories, so it is easy to filter and find them by category.
A books that user plans to buy they add to a shopping cart. After creating an order 
the shopping cart is cleared.

JWT is used. It is sent to the user after login and protects access to the app.
All users are divided into admins and users which provides them with certain rights in the app.

a certain book, they can see all categories and all books present in one category. 
Users can put a book into a shopping cart, change chosen quantity, delete it from shopping cart or see all
books that they added there before. Also, they can place an order, see their order history, items from a
